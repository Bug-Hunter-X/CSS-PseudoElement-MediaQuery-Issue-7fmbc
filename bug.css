The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error where using a pseudo-element selector inside a media query doesn't work as expected. The issue is the pseudo-element selectors are not being applied within the specific media query breakpoint. 
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container::before {
    content: "Mobile";
  }
}
```
This might happen because of specificity issues or CSS cascade behaviour within the media query context.
